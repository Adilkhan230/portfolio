# My Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio (in progress)

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
My name is **Adilkhan Ospanov**, and I am a 4th-year student in **Economics and Data Science** at **Maqsut Narikbayev University**.  
This repository showcases my projects in **data science**, **machine learning**, and **statistical analysis**, including works from various competitions I have participated in.  

Each folder contains a self-contained project with code, and some also include datasets. The projects cover topics such as:  
- Predictive modeling  
- Data visualization  
- Feature engineering  
- Statistical analysis  

My work combines strong analytical skills with practical implementation, focusing on **real-world problem solving** and producing **clear, reproducible results**.
